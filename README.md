# 💊 LifeTag  
**From hospital shelves to patient hands — safe every step**

LifeTag is a **smart digital medicine safety and traceability system** designed to ensure safe, verified, and monitored medicine usage across patients, doctors, and pharmacies using **QR-based prescriptions, real-time alerts, and AI-driven adherence monitoring**.

---

## 🚀 What This Project Does

LifeTag creates a **connected and intelligent medicine ecosystem** that:
- ✔ Prevents expired or unauthorized medicine dispensing  
- ✔ Reduces missed doses, double-dosing, and misuse  
- ✔ Enables real-time expiry & recall alerts  
- ✔ Connects doctors, pharmacies, and patients on a single platform  

The system ensures **accountability, safety, and compliance** throughout the medicine lifecycle.

## 🧠 Framework Overview (LifeTag Pipeline)

1. 🧾 **Digital Prescription Generation**  
   Each prescription is issued with a unique **QR code** linked to medicine, batch, and expiry details.

2. 🏪 **Pharmacy Verification**  
   Chemists scan QR codes before dispensing to verify:
   - Valid prescription
   - Non-expired medicine
   - Authentic records

3. 🔔 **Automated Alerts & Notifications**  
   Expiry, recall, and safety alerts sent via **email / app notifications**.

4. 🤖 **AI-Powered Adherence Monitoring**  
   Detects missed doses, double-dosing, and irregular intake patterns.

5. 📊 **Centralized Dashboard**  
   Unified digital dashboard for doctors, patients, and pharmacies.
